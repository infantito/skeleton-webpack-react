# Skeleton-Webpack-React

React-webpack2-skeleton is a lightweight React boilerplate that uses Webpack3. url-loader, postcss-loader, image-webpack-loader, babel-preset-env and react-hot-loader have been configured to this project by default.

## Requirement

- Node `^6.x.x`
- yarn `>= ^1.x.x` or npm `>= ^3.x.x` 

## Getting started

First, clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:infantito/skeleton-webpack-react.git <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
```

Then, install the dependencies. It is recommended to use Yarn, (because it is blazing fast). You can still use npm as well.

```bash
$ yarn install # or npm install
```

## Script usage

You can execute the scripts below by `yarn run <script>` or `npm run <script>`.

| Command | Description                                                   |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| start   | Starts webpack development server; served at `localhost:8080` |
| build   | Bundles the source in `~/build` directory                     |
